## Vision Statement

Our project will help people to learn and practice topics they are interested in. 

The core of the project is a video game that focuses on allowing users to create quizzes, compete in leaderboards for quizzes, and create a reliable way to have fun studying through trivia games. The primary users of this project will consist of students at any level of learning, as it will provide them with a reliable space to study, while also tracking their progress. The secondary users will be that of the educators, this will provide an environment for them to make use of competition to understand where a learner may be struggling. Lastly, the tertiary group of users will consist of people who wish to take any topic, and practice their knowledge of it, examples would include hobbies, music, etc.

This project is valuable as there are many applications that focus solely on studying, or head to head trivia competition rather than allowing a user to freely track their progress.
