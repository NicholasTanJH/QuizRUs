<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Quiz"R"Us: Where Fun Meets Learning</h1>

>**Quiz"R"Us** is a video game quizzing tool that provides an engaging and fun alternative to helping people study and learn.

The core of the project is a video game that focuses on allowing users to create quizzes, compete in leaderboards for quizzes, and create a reliable way to study through trivia games. 

This project is valuable as many applications focus solely on studying, or head-to-head trivia competition rather than allowing users to study in a fun and competitive environment. Just as students write on index cards to study for tests, we provide an alternative that reduces wasting paper, while imitating real tests in a fun environment. Using a reward-based system (with the leaderboard) and creating an interesting and fun environment will help support the learning process. With the inclusion of a timer on quizzes, users are given the ability to practice answering questions within a certain amount of time, imitating a real exam. We are committed to putting users first by adding features that enhance their experience, making studying more interactive and enjoyable. Users will not only have the opportunity to create a fully custom quiz, they will be able to find new quizzes created by others and manage their quizzes. Finally, this app offers a wide variety of trivia questions, perfect for anyone looking to expand their knowledge while having fun.

## Intended Users: Who QuizRUs is For

The primary users of this project will consist of **students** at any level of learning, as it will provide them with a space to study, while also tracking their progress. The secondary users will be **educators**; Quiz"R"Us will provide an environment for them to use the leaderboard to understand where a student may be struggling. Lastly, the tertiary group of users will consist of **people who wish to take any topic and practice their knowledge of it**.
