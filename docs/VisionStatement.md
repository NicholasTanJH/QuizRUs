# Quiz"R"Us

> Quiz"R"Us is a video game quizzing tool that provides an engaging and fun alternative to helping people study and learn.

The core of the project is a video game that focuses on allowing users to create quizzes, compete in leaderboards for quizzes, and create a reliable way to study through trivia games. The primary users of this project will consist of students at any level of learning, as it will provide them with a space to study, while also tracking their progress. The secondary users will be educators; Quiz"R"Us will provide an environment for them to use the leaderboard to understand where a student may be struggling. Lastly, the tertiary group of users will consist of people who wish to take any topic and practice their knowledge of it.

This project is valuable as many applications focus solely on studying, or head-to-head trivia competition rather than allowing users to study in a fun and competitive environment. Just as students write on index cards to study for tests, we provide an alternative that reduces wasting paper, while imitating real tests in a fun environment. Using a reward-based system (with the leaderboard) and creating an interesting and fun environment will help support the learning process. With the inclusion of a timer on quizzes, users are given the ability to practice answering questions within a certain amount of time, imitating a real exam. We are committed to putting users first by adding features that enhance their experience, making studying more interactive and enjoyable. Users will not only have the opportunity to create a fully custom quiz, they will be able to find new quizzes created by others and manage their quizzes. Finally, this app offers a wide variety of trivia questions, perfect for anyone looking to expand their knowledge while having fun.

The success of this application will be measured through several key criteria. First, the number of downloads will serve as a primary indicatorwith an expected increase at the start of each school term at educational institutions. Our goal is to reach 50 downloads at the begining of each semester over the next 2 years. Another important measure is the number of user accounts created. Since a single user may create multiple accounts, tracking this metric will help us assess engagement. Our target is to have 75 new accounts created at the end of each school term, totalling 225 acounts per year. The number of user created quizzes will also serve as an indicator of the success, as it signals interaction with our product. We aim for at least one quiz created for every two users, recognizing that some may prefer to play existing quizzes rather than create their own.. Lastly, the time users spend on the app and their learning progress will reflect the appâ€™s effectiveness in promoting education and improving learners. In our first year, success will be defined as users spending an average of 30 minutes per day on the platform.
